0. Introduction.

The Fidonet consists of individual systems operated by different
people. To maintain proper connectivity, these systems should set
stationary trusted links between them to ensure smooth echomail
distribution.


1. The Problem

The problem is that sysops have to agree to set these stationary
links first, and this may require time-stretched discussion.


2. The solution.

The solution is the joint drinking beer during these discussions.
Many years of experience show us how greatly joint drinking beer
increases the mutual understanding, so this method definitely is
the common practice.

This is why the BEER nodelist flag is introduced. The most typical
syntax has no parameters, like ",CM,BEER,IBN,INA:...", which just
tells others that SysOp drinks beer. Some more complex applications
may require refinements and clarifications in the flag parameters,
like "BEER:dark_lager" or "BEER:mild_ale". Even the most preferred
snacks and other addons may be published, like "BEER:with_crisps".
