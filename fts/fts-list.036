                       Status of Current FidoNet Standards
                               February 5,  1990
     
     

                   This document replaces FSC-0018 and FSC-0026
                       


   1. FTS-0001 (was FSC001-9,  FSC-0001) is the basic falback standard for
      use on FidoNet.  All mailers must be able to perform this protocol
      should other negotiations fail.

      FTS-0001 describes transmitted data structures, record and message
      formats, as well as the actual transmission protocols used.

   2. FTS-0002 (obsolete,  replaced by FTS-0005)

   3. FTS-0003 (obsolete,  replaced by FTS-0006)

   4. FTS-0004 (was FSC-0012) describes the transmitted form of EchoMail.
      Lack of other detailed specifications led us to extract this document
      from the documentation of a FidoNet utility, with the kind permission
      of its author, Bob Hartman.

      FTS-0004 describes echo history, topologies, and message formats.

   5. FTS-0005 (replaces FTS-0002) defines the format of the distributed
      FidoNet nodelist.

   6. FTS-0006 (replaces FTS-0003,  updates FTS-0001) describes a
      capability exchange protocol (YooHoo/2U2),  which allows two FidoNet
      systems to dynamically negotiate (at the start of a session) which
      of a list of protocols is to be used.  FTS-0006 is also known as the
      WaZOO protocol,  and the WaZOO method of making file/update requests
      is also defined here.

      FTS-0006 is used as the base for protocol experimentation on
      FidoNet.

   7. FTS-0007 (updates FTS-0001) describes the SEAlink protocol extension
      to FTS-0001.

   8. FTS-0008 (updates FTS-0001) describes the Bark protocol extension
      to FTS-0001.  Bark is a method of making file/update requests.

   9. ARCmail is as specified in the System Enhancement Associates
      documentation for ARCmail version 0.6.

      It consists of ARCed files named
          nnnnmmmm.dd#
      where nnnn is (orignet-destnet) in hex, mmmm is (orignode-destnode)
      in hex, dd is a day of the week in the form MO, TU, WE,TH, FR, SA,
      or SU, and # is a decimal digit.

      These ARCmail files consist of multiple FTS-0001 mail packets of
      multiple EchoMail messages with AREA:<areaname> lines etc.  These
      packets are named
          ddhhmmssxx.PKT
      where dd is the day of the month in decimal, hhmmss is the hour
      minute and second in decimal, and xx is hundreths of a second in
      decimal.
