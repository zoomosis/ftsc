1. Introduction
---------------

  The Fidonet Distribution Nodelist (FTS-5000) is a comma-delimited
  database, i.e. each node's entry is made up of fields, each of which
  has a specific purpose.

  While this is a fine system for holding information that all nodes
  must have (e.g. node number, sysop name, etc.) it is not well suited
  for data that varies wildly from system to system.  To accommodate
  such data, the flag fields are defined as self-describing and
  non-position dependent fields.

  This document is a registry of all commonly used flags in Fidonet,
  and companion to FTS-5000 in describing the Distribution Nodelist.


2. Supersessions
----------------

  This document supersedes and replaces FTS-0005, FSC-0009, FSC-0040,
  FSC-0062, FSC-0075 and FSC-0091.


3. Purpose
----------

  As with FTS-5000, this document is intended for both developers and
  nodelist maintainers to avoid duplication and conflicts.  Normal
  sysops would also do well to have at least cursory knowledge of the
  nodelist's capabilities so they may provide their Coordinators with
  all the pertinent detail of their systems.

  This document should be considered a guide, and not the final word
  on what are and aren't valid flags.  There will obviously be an
  unavoidable lag between the introduction of new flags and their
  inclusion in this document, as well as experimental flags that will
  come and go with no official documentation at all.


4. Syntax
---------

  Most flags are simple tokens that each occupy a single field and by
  their presence or absence in the nodelist, indicate the presence or
  absence of a certain feature in the node.

  A more recent style is to subdivide the flag field, usually with a
  colon (3Ah) to allow for variable data under a common flag.  These
  are essentially named fields, consisting of the flag itself and its
  payload as one or more subfields.

  Unless otherwise stated, flags are not position or order dependent,
  with the exception that User Flags must follow Normal Flags.


5. Normal flags
---------------

5.1. Operating Condition Flags
------------------------------

  Flag  Meaning

    CM  Node accepts mail 24 hours a day using all listed methods
   ICM  Node accepts mail 24 hours a day using all listed TCP/IP
        methods, but not all of the other listed methods (such as
        PSTN/ISDN) and therefore cannot be CM.  See FSP-1033.
    MO  Node does not accept human callers
    LO  Node accepts calls Only from Listed FidoNet addresses
    MN  No packet compression supported

    * NOTE: maximum possible speed; actual maximum will vary
      depending on implementation.


5.3. Session Level Error-correction and Compression Flags
---------------------------------------------------------

  The following flags define type of error correction and/or data
  compression available. A separate error correction flag should not
  be used when the error correction type can be determined by the
  modem flag. See section I for details.

      Flag  Meaning

      MNP   Microcom Networking Protocol error correction
            of type MNP1 to MNP4
      V42   ITU-T V.42: LAP-M error correction with fallback
            to MNP 1-4
      V42b  ITU-T V.42bis: LAP-M error correction and
            compression with fallback to MNP 1-5


5.4. File/Update Request Flags
------------------------------

  The following table shows the flags indicating various types of
  file/update requests supported:

    +-----------------------------------+


5.5. Gateway Flag
-----------------

  The following flag defines gateways to other domains (networks).

    Flag   Meaning

    Gx..x  Gateway to domain 'x..x', where 'x..x` is a string
           of alphanumeric characters. Valid values for
           'x..x' are assigned by the FidoNet International
           Coordinator or the Zone Coordinators Council. They
           will also adequately distribute a list of valid
           values.


5.6. Mail Period Flags
----------------------

  The Mail Period Flags indicate compliance with another zone's ZMH.
  Since ZMH is mandatory within one's own zone, it is not indicated.

  These flags have the form "#nn" or !nn where nn is the UTC hour the
  mail period begins, # indicates Bell 212A compatibility, and !
  indicates incompatibility with Bell 212A.  For example:

    Flag   Meaning

    #01    Zone 5 mail hour (01:00 - 02:00 UTC)
    #02    Zone 2 mail hour (02:30 - 03:30 UTC)
    #08    Zone 4 mail hour (08:00 - 09:00 UTC)
    #09    Zone 1 mail hour (09:00 - 10:00 UTC)
    #17    Zone 3 mail hour (17:00 - 18:00 UTC)
    #20    Zone 6 mail hour (20:00 - 21:00 UTC)

  The above listing of the ZMH for each individual zone is only given
  for your convenience. It was correct at the time of this writing,
  but could be changed at any time by following the procedures
  established in Fidonet policy. The FTSC has no role in determining
  the Mail Hour of any Zone. You'll find an up-to-date list in the
  comments at the end of the Fidonet Nodelist.

  NOTE:  When applicable, the mail period flags may be strung together
  with no intervening commas, e.g. "#02#09".


5.7. System Online Flags
------------------------

  The flag Tyz is used by non-CM nodes online not only during ZMH, y
  is a letter indicating the start and z a letter indicating the end
  of the online period as defined below (times in UTC):

    A  0:00,  a  0:30,   B  1:00,  b  1:30,   C  2:00,  c  2:30,
    D  3:00,  d  3:30,   E  4:00,  e  4:30,   F  5:00,  f  5:30,
    G  6:00,  g  6:30,   H  7:00,  h  7:30,   I  8:00,  i  8:30,
    J  9:00,  j  9:30,   K 10:00,  k 10:30,   L 11:00,  l 11:30,
    M 12:00,  m 12:30,   N 13:00,  n 13:30,   O 14:00,  o 14:30,
    P 15:00,  p 15:30,   Q 16:00,  q 16:30,   R 17:00,  r 17:30,
    S 18:00,  s 18:30,   T 19:00,  t 19:30,   U 20:00,  u 20:30,
    V 21:00,  v 21:30,   W 22:00,  w 22:30,   X 23:00,  x 23:30.

  For example TuB shows an online period from 20:30 until 1:00 UTC.


  Daylight saving time
  --------------------

  If a node changes online times with respect to UTC when daylight
  saving time becomes effective (which would be the case with most
  part time nodes), then this is to be taken into account when
  assigning this flag. An online times flag assigned to a node should
  not be altered for the specific purpose of adjusting due to daylight
  saving time, since large difference files (NODEDIFF's) would result
  if every node was allowed to do this, e.g. my node used to be online
  from 2300 to 0800 in local time, which in winter is UTC, but in the
  summer it becomes BST (British Summer Time). This is one hour ahead
  of UTC, and the corresponding availability times of my node during
  the summer period were 2200 to 0700 UTC. Therefore my online times
  flag would have indicated availability between the hours of 2300 and
  0700 UTC, the daily time period encompassing both times, so the flag
  would be TXH.


5.8. ISDN Capability Flags
--------------------------

  Nodelist   Specification of minimal support required for this flag;
      flag   any additional support to be arranged via agreement
             between users

   V110L     ITU-T V.110 19k2 async ('low').
             NOTE: some implementations are limited to 9600bps.
   V110H     ITU-T V.110 38k4 async ('high').
   V120L     ITU-T V.120 56k async, layer 2 framesize 259, window 7,
             modulo 8.
   V120H     ITU-T V.120 64k async, layer 2 framesize 259, window 7,
             modulo 8.
   X75       ITU-T X.75 SLP (single link procedure) with 64kbit/s B
             channel; layer 2 max. framesize 2048, window 2, non-ext.
             mode (modulo 8); layer 3 transparent (no packet layer).
   ISDN      Other configurations. Use only if none of the above
             fits.

   NOTE: No flag implies another. Each capability MUST be specifically
   listed.


5.9. Internet Capabilities
--------------------------

Basic Syntax
------------

  Internet capability flags use the format:

    <flag>[:<internet address>][:<port>]

  Where <internet address> is:

    * an IP address in dotted-quad format, or
    * a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), or
    * an email address,

  depending on the protocol, and <port> is the service port number.

  <internet address> may be omitted if the address is available in
  another field (see below).  <port> may be omitted if it is the
  default port for that particular service, and is not permitted for
  email addresses.

  The mailer software is expected to be able to determine whether
  <internet address> is an IP quad, FQDN or email address by itself.


Advanced usage
--------------

  Several methods of listing Internet capability flags are in wide
  usage and subject to change at any time.  Internet capable software
  should provide a suitable manual override mechanism to compensate
  for the volatility of the nodelist format, and be able to deal with
  prolonged connection failures (e.g. by automatically putting waiting
  mail on hold, and notifying the local sysop).


  Shorthand flags
  ---------------

  For brevity, a node that lists multiple Internet capability flags
  that require the same address may list the address only once, and
  specify only port numbers per flag if required.

  Ideally, a node should use the flags specifically intended for this
  purpose, but that is not always the case.  Be prepared to look for
  addresses under any flag of the same type.


  Alternate fields
  ----------------

  If the address is not attached to any of the Internet capability
  flags, it may be present in another field (see FTS-5000).

  Because of this, systems using Internet capability flags should
  avoid entering data in such fields that may be mistaken for Internet
  related information.  For example, a node with an email flag should
  not use a system name that could be confused with an email address.


  Default to DNS
  --------------

  In the event that no address information can be found, it is often
  assumed to be part of the fidonet.net DNS Distributed Nodelist (DDN)
  project, allowing the FQDN to be generated from the FTN address.

  The DDN domain format is:

    [p<point>.]f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.<root domain>

  Where <root domain> in this case is fidonet.net, and the point field
  is omitted if zero.


Indirect Delivery
-----------------

  Not all Internet tunneling methods require the originating node and
  the destination node to make a direct, realtime connection.  Relays
  though the FTP or email servers of an ISP, for example.

  To avoid unusual delays, nodes using such 3rd party relays should
  check regularly for new mail -- daily for non-CM nodes, and hourly
  for CM nodes is recommended.

  Where multiple protocols are available, the originating node should
  select the most direct method, and avoid protocols that may be using
  relays.


Standard Flags
--------------

        Default
  Flag     port  Description
  --------------------------

   INA   (none)  This flag sets the default Internet address used
                 for any non-email based flag that does not specify
                 its own.
   IP    (none)  Mostly used during the introduction of IP capable
                 systems to the nodelist, is similar to the INA flag
                 but may or may not specify an Internet address.
                 Both usages are depreciated in favour of INA.

   IBN    24554  Binkp (FSP-1011)
   IFC    60179  RAW ifcico (FTS-1024)
   IFT       21  FTP (RFC-0959); Note there is currently no widely
                 accepted authentication scheme for FTP transfers by
                 Fidonet mailers.
   ITN       23  FTS-0001 over Telnet connection
   IVM     3141  FTS-0001 over Vmodem connection


Email Flags
-----------

  To use the flag for any Email method providing for return receipts
  (currently ITX and ISE) a node *must* have them enabled and send
  such receipts within 24 hours of receiving a file.

        Default
  Flag     port  Description
  --------------------------

   IEM   (none)  Indicates an unspecified mail tunnelling method (old
                 usage, similar to IP), or sets the default email
                 address for other flags (similar to INA)

   ITX       25  TransX encoding for email tunnelling with receipts
                 enabled.
   IUC       25  uuencoding of mail bundles
   IMI       25  MIME encoding of mail bundles
   ISE       25  SEAT protocol for Email tunnelling with receipts.
                 enabled; should always be accompanied by IUC and/or
                 IMI.


Reliability
-----------

  It should be noted that only some of these Internet based methods
  (currently IBN, IFC, ITN, IVM, ITX and ISE) can give the sender a
  proof of receipt of a file by the addressee, like FTS-0001 does.

  Other methods have no guarantee of reliability, so they shouldn't be
  used to transmit critical data.

  Also, nodelist segment maintainers should take into account the
  presence of at least one of these reliable protocols when deciding
  on application for Fidonet membership by nodes without a dial-up
  connection.


5.10. Robot flags
-----------------

  PING
  ----

    Specified as exactly "PING" with no arguments.  Nodes flying this
    flag will adhere to the following functionality:

    1) PING-function:

    If a message destined to "PING" arrives at its final destination
    and this final destination flies the "PING"-flag, then the
    receiving node will bounce the message back to the original sender
    clearly displaying all the original via-lines.

    If a message destined to "PING" arrives at its final destination
    but this final destination does _not_ fly the "PING"-flag then the
    message may be deleted from the inbound-queue without further
    follow-up.

    2) TRACE-function:

    If a message destined to "PING" arrives at a node which flies the
    PING-flag but is merely passing-through to another destination
    then the in-transit node will notify the sender of this occurrence
    and will forward the original mail unaltered towards its final
    destination.

    WARNING: the sender's name (in either direction) must *NEVER* be
    "PING".


5.11. Flag Redundancies
-----------------------

   Only the smallest possible set of flags should be used in each
   entry.

   Since different people might have different perception of modem
   flag redundancies, the FTSC decided to provide a standard table.

   The relation "implies" means either that the first protocol
   requires all the others as a fallback or that to all practical
   purposes all modems which have been manufactured until today (and
   conceivably even future ones) implemented the other protocols
   anyway.

   For example, the protocol V.32bis implies V.32 because it's
   required as a fallback; on the other hand, V.32Terbo implies
   V.32bis because practically all modems with V.32Terbo also had
   V.32bis to connect to existing modems, even though it wasn't
   required in the protocol specifications.

   V32   implies  V22
   V32B  implies  V22 V32
   V34   implies  V22 V32 V32B
   V90C  implies  V22 V32 V32B V34
   V90S  implies  V22 V32 V32B V34

   V42   implies  MNP
   V42B  implies  V42 MNP

   V32T  implies  V22 V32 V32B
   VFC   implies  V22 V32 V32B

   HST   implies  MNP
   H14   implies  HST MNP
   H16   implies  HST H14 MNP V42 V42B

   X2C   implies  V22 V32 V32B V34
   X2S   implies  V22 V32 V32B V34

   ZYX   implies  V22 V32 V32B V42 V42B MNP
   Z19   implies  V22 V32 V32B V42 V42B MNP ZYX

   Please note also that:
   . the V90C and V90S flags are mutually exclusive.
   . the X2C and X2CS flags are are mutually exclusive.
   . no modem has at the same time the US Robotics proprietary
     protocols and the ZyXEL ones; so, use of any flag in the group
     HST, H14, H16, X2S and X2C is incompatible with any of the ZYX
     and Z19 flags, and vice versa.
   . all X? flags are mutually exclusive.
   . the CM flag is incompatible with any of the #??, !?? or T??
     flags.
   . the CM implies ICM; ICM should not be used unless CM is
     impossible.


6. Userflags
------------

  It is impossible to document all user flags in use.  The FTSC makes
  no attempt at it.  This document lists those flags which got at
  least some kind of official sanction or were deemed of technical
  interest by FTSC.


6.1 Format Of User Flags
------------------------

  U,x..x

  A user-specified string, which may contain any alphanumeric
  character except blanks. This string may contain one to thirty-two
  characters of information that may be used to add user-defined data
  to a specific nodelist entry. The character "U" must not be
  repeated, eg, ",U,XXX,YYY,ZZZ" not ",U,XXX,U,YYY,UZZZ". The 32
  character limitation is per userflag, not for the total of all
  userflags.

  New implementations must place a comma after the initial "U" before
  the user flags. Some implementations will not place a separating
  comma between the "U" and the first user flag, but this practice is
  deprecated. Implementations should be prepared to read flags in this
  format, and must strip the "U" from the flag before analysis in this
  case.

  Entries following the "U" flag must be of a technical or
  administrative nature. While experimentation of new software
  functions using this flag is encouraged, advertisement is strictly
  prohibited.

  For applications other than those shown, or if you have questions
  concerning the use of this field, please contact your Regional or
  Zone Coordinator.

  Developers should note that the distinction between "normal" flags
  and user flags is a non-technical, purely political one. It often
  happened that a user flag was "promoted" to regular status, and the
  reverse could conceivably happen. It is recommended that, while
  parsing nodelist entries, no distinction at all be done between the
  two categories of flags.


6.2. Mail Oriented User Flags
-----------------------------

  Flag   Meaning

  ZEC    Zone EchoMail Coordinator.  Not more than one entry in the
         zone segment may carry this flag and that entry must be the
         current Zone EchoMail Coordinator.

  REC    Regional EchoMail Coordinator.  Not more than one entry in
         any region may carry this flag and that entry must be the
         current Regional EchoMail Coordinator.

  NEC    Network EchoMail coordinator.  Not more than one entry in any
         net may carry this flag and that entry must be the current
         Network EchoMail Coordinator of that Net.

  NC     Network Coordinator.  This flag is ONLY to be used by the
         Network Coordinator of a net which has split the duties of NC
         and Host and the NC does NOT occupy the Net/0 position in the
         nodelist.

  SDS    Software Distribution System

  SMH    Secure Mail Hub - or one of the following variations,
         indication the specific level of the hub:

           NSMH - Net SecureMail Host - only one per net
           RSMH - Region SecureMail Host - only one per region
           ZSMH - Zone SecureMail Host - only one in Zone 1
           ISMH - International SecureMail Host - only one in
                  Fidonet

  RPK    Regional Pointlist Keeper.  This user-flag identifies the
         person who compiles the region-pointlist (only 1 entry per
         region allowed)

  NPK    Net Pointlist Keeper.  This user-flag identifies the person
         who compiles the net-pointlist (only 1 entry per net allowed)


  ENC    This node accepts inbound encrypted mail and will route it
         like other mail

  CDP    This node will accept points auto-created by the CD-point
         software.
