  This document is a Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP).

  This document proposes a Fidonet standard for the Fidonet
  community.

  This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
  copied or modified for any purpose whatever.


1. Introduction
---------------

  BinkleyTerm Style Outbound (BSO) flow and control files are used
  for a long time but still are not documented fully. This has led
  to software developers using a different approaches that makes
  change of mailer on FTN station rather sophisticated. This document
  combines original ideas, introduced by by Vince Perriello and Bob
  Hartman (BinkleyTerm), and Andy Elkin (T-Mail).


2. Definitions
--------------

  Flow file - a file with specific name and various extension that
  contains extension specific information to be sent to remote side.

  Control file - same as flow file but usually does not contain any
  information inside. Its purpose to control behavior all software
  dealing with BSO. Reduced flow file (file does not contain any
  information inside or zero length) also may be considered as control
  file.

  Outbound directory (outbound) - directory, were flow and control
  files are stored.

  Name of flow file is formed from network and node number of remote
  system, expressed as 4 hexadecimal digits each, zero-padded on the
  left. Thus information concerning to node 104/36 is stored in flow
  and control files with name "00680024" with different extension.
  Hexadecimal digits must be lower case if it is supported by OS file
  system.

  For supporting point systems in outbound is created sub-directory
  with name "<nff>.pnt", where <nff> - name of flow file as described
  above. In this directory flow and control files is created with
  name formed from point number as 8 hexadecimal digits zero-padded on
  the left. Thus information concerning to point 104/36.45 is stored
  in subdirectory "00680024.pnt" in flow and control files with name
  "0000002d" with different extensions. "pnt" must be lower case if it
  is supported by OS file system.

  For supporting communications with systems from a different zone the
  number of directories are created with same generic name chosen
  arbitrary and quasi extension equal to zone number expressed as 3
  hexadecimal digits zero-padded on the left. If zone number > 4095
  then 4 hexadecimal digits are used in quasi extension. The last can
  be implemented *only* on modern OS. Thus information concerning to
  node 2:104/36 is stored in directory "outbound.002" in flow and
  control files with name "00680024" with different extensions.
  "outbound" is assumed to be generic name. The last must be lower
  case if it is supported by OS file system.

  Any zone number may be chosen as own zone number. In this case
  directory with generic name without quasi extension is functionally
  equal to directory with quasi extension equal to own zone number.
  If we consider node 1:234/5, own zone is 1 for it, thus "outbound"
  and "outbound.001" are both valid directories for storing flow and
  control files and it is recommended to check both of them but create
  flow and control files only in first, "outbound".

  Restrictions in term of this document are time intervals when there
  is not desirable to call remote system. Restrictions may be external
  introducing for example by nodelist's information or internal due to
  economical or organizational reasons.


3. Flow files
-------------

  Flow files contain references to information to be sent to remote
  system. Address of remote system and name of this file has
  one-to-one correspondence. They are divided by type and flavour.

  The extension must be lower case if it is supported by OS file
  system.

  3.1. Types of flow file

       There are 3 types of flow files: netmail, file reference, file
       request.

       Netmail flow files are a FTS-0001 packet containing packed
       netmail as described in FTS-0001. This flow file has
       signature "ut" as 2nd ant 3rd letters in extension. During
       session this file must be renamed dynamically at the moment
       of sending to remote system with unique name and extension
       "pkt". Method of creating unique name is implementation
       dependent.

       This file must be transferred to remote system at any successful
       session. Would session terminated accidentally during sending
       this file it must be resent in next session from the
       beginning. After successful transmission file must be deleted
       from outbound.

       Reference files consist of number of lines (terminated by 0x0a
       or 0x0d,0x0a) which consist of one char directive followed by
       name file to transfer to remote system. It has signature "lo"
       as 2nd ant 3rd letters in extension.

       There are 4 directives in reference file.
       " " (space) or absent any listed below - just send file
       indicated in line. If file name to send starts with "#" or "!"
       first char must be space.
       "#" - truncate the indicated file to zero-length after
       successfully sending the file to the remote system. This is
       normally only employed when sending compressed mail (archived
       mail) to the remote.
       "^" - delete the file after sending.
       "!" - skip the line from treatment. It may be useful to mark
       already processed line.

       If indicated file name does not contain symbols, showing
       presence of a path in file name, it may be located in same
       with flow files directory. Sysop must avoid ambiguity in this
       case. If a file is not found, software must ignore the line and
       continue processing.

       Would mailer send or not files listed in reference file during
       the successful session depends on flavour of reference file.

       After successful transmission of listed files flow file must be
       deleted from outbound. (But see below.) Would session
       terminated accidentally during sending listed files, flow file
       must be processed in next session from the beginning.

       File request has signature "req" as extension. Information in
       request file is described in FTS-0006. File request has direct
       flavour with possible additional restriction specific to file
       request. Normally this file is deleted after receiving
       requested files.

       Reduced request file has no meaning and must be ignored.

  3.2. Flavours of flow file

       Flavour of flow file controls mailer's behavior. It can
       initiate poll to remote system. Especially it is useful with
       reduced flow file. Creating such flow file may force mailer to
       do action that is not specified in normal mode of operation.

       It is recommended to use as reduced flow file only reference
       files and use method of "touch", creating new file if absent
       or change file date to current if one exists. Difference in
       mailer behavior for flow and reduced flow file is decribed
       later.

       There are 5 flavours.

       Immediate has "i" as 1st char in extension. Thus full
       extension of netmail file is "iut" and for reference file is
       "ilo". If flow file with such flavour exists mailer must try to
       poll remote system without taking in consideration external and
       internal restrictions, just immediately. During successful
       session files listed in "ilo" file must be sent to remote
       system. It is assumed, that information mentioned in "iut" and
       "ilo" may be sent to the specific system only. Very often
       reduced form is used only for making poll.

       Continuous has "c" as 1st char in extension. Thus full
       extension of netmail file is "cut" and for reference file is
       "clo". If flow file with such flavour exists mailer must try to
       poll remote system taking in consideration internal restriction
       but not external (assuming that remote system has CM flag).
       During successful session files listed in "clo" file must be
       sent to remote system. It is assumed, that information
       mentioned in "cut" and "clo" may be sent to the specific system
       only. During session information in continuous flow file is
       transmitted after one in immediate flow file. Very often
       reduced form is used only for making poll.

       Direct has "d" as 1st char in extension. Thus full extension of
       netmail file is "dut" and for reference file is "dlo". If flow
       file with such flavour exists mailer must try to poll remote
       system taking in consideration both external and internal
       restrictions. During successful session files listed in "dlo"
       file must be sent to remote system. It is assumed, that
       information mentioned in "dut" and "dlo" may be sent to the
       specific system only. During session information in direct flow
       file is transmitted after one in continuous flow file.

       Normal has "o" as 1st char in extension for netamil and "f" for
       reference file (using of "n" is considered as outdated). Thus
       full extension of netmail file is "out" and for reference file
       is "flo". If flow file with such flavour exists mailer must try
       to poll remote system taking in consideration both external and
       internal restrictions. During successful session files listed
       in "flo" file must be sent to remote system. It is assumed,
       that information mentioned in "out" and "flo" may be rerouted
       by specific programs (such as netmail tracker) to another
       system. During session information in normal flow file is
       transmitted after one in direct flow file.

       Hold has "h" as 1st char in extension. Thus full extension of
       netmail file is "hut" and for reference file is "hlo". Flow
       file with such flavour instructs mailer wait a poll from remote
       system. During successful session files listed in "hlo" file
       must be sent if originating is remote system. Sending files
       listed in "hlo" file in case when originating is our system is
       implementation dependent. It is assumed, that information
       mentioned in "hut" and "hlo" may be rerouted by specific
       programs (such as netmail tracker) to another system. During
       session information in hold flow file is transmitted after one
       in normal flow file.

  3.3. Simple time chart.

       Suppose our node has working hours from 21:00 till 09:00. Let
       remote system has working hours from 17:00 till 07:00. Next
       time chart indicates period, when poll is produced for different
       flavours:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  |12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|00|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
i |xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|
c |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|--|
d |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|--|--|--|
f |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|--|--|--|
h |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.4. Differences in flow and reduced flow files.

        "Real" flow file means that system have a portion of
        information to be sent but reduced flow file only expresses
        desire to make poll.

        Thus would mailer detects presence of flow file in directory it
        must make a conclusion about is it real flow file or just
        control file.

        If it is real flow file mailer must make poll according its
        flavour, send information to remote according type of flow
        file and delete flow file after sending all information don't
        waiting end of session.

        Thus if session is terminated accidentally or specially by
        sysop after sending flow file information mailer will return
        in state without priority flow file in outbound.

        If it is reduced flow file mailer must make poll according its
        flavour. Mailer has nothing to send from control file and it
        must delete flow file after successful end of session.

        Thus if session is terminated accidentally or specially by
        sysop during sending another information mailer will return
        in state with priority flow file in outbound.

        That is why it is not a good idea to lock flow files during
        the session.


4. Control files
----------------

  4.1.  bsy (busy) control file

        It is main control file that must be used by any software
        dealing with flow files in BSO. It has name same as flow file and
        extension ".bsy".

        Any software must check this file before doing any changes
        in flow files. If bsy-file exists all changes are prohibited
        in any corresponding flow files. What a software have to do in
        this case is implementation dependent.

        If bsy-file does not exist software must touch this file,
        ensure that it was successfully created, and work with flow
        files. After ending of the job software must delete bsy-file.

        During the session and before sending information from flow
        files mailer creates the list of all AKAs presented by the
        remote system. Then mailer must check bsy-files corresponding
        to the list. If some bsy-file is detected corresponding AKA is
        removed from the list. If all AKA are removed due to this
        procedure, session must be terminated with appropriate
        diagnostic message.

        If bsy-file for the AKA is not present mailer must touch
        them. bsy-file is created by mailer only after successful
        connection with remote mailer.

        After session - successful or not - mailer must delete all
        touched bsy-files.

        After restoring system due to crash it is recommended to do
        simple routine to delete all bsy-files in all outbounds before
        starting any software dealing with BSO.

        It is also recommended to check the age of bsy-files. It is
        reasonable to ignore and delete bsy-files with age more than
        maximum estimated time of session multiplied on 2.
        Appropriate diagnostic message may be produced in this case.

        For information purpose bsy-file may contain one line PID
        information (less that 70 characters).

  4.2.  csy (call) control file

        This control file is created by mailer when it decides
        to make poll to remote system. csy-file is valuable only for
        another mailer working together on the same system. It has
        name same as flow file and extension ".csy".

        csy-files are created for all remote AKAs which is possible
        to find out in mailer config.

        Presence csy-file corresponding to any remote AKA indicates
        that mailer must stop try to poll remote system regardless of
        presence flow files.

        After session - successful or not - and after unsuccessful try
        mailer must delete all touched csy-files.

        After restoring system due to crash it is recommended to do
        simple routine to delete all csy-files in all outbounds before
        starting any software dealing with BSO.

        It is also recommended to check the age of csy-files. It is
        reasonable to ignore and delete csy-files with age more than
        maximum estimated time of session multiplied on 2.
        Appropriate diagnostic message may be produced in this case.

        For information purpose csy-file may contain one line PID
        information.

  4.3.  hld (hold) control file

        This control file is created by a mailer or other software
        when it decides to stop trying poll remote system.
        hld-file is valuable only for mailers. It has name same as
        flow file and extension ".hld".

        Existing hld-file is replaced by new one or edited.

        hld-file must contain one line string with expiration of hold
        period expressed in UNIX-time.

        Presence hld-file corresponding to any remote AKA indicates
        that mailer must check the content before trying to poll
        remote system. If expiration time is in future mailer must
        stop try to poll remote system regardless of presence flow
        files.

        Presence and content of hld-file must be checked before each
        attempt to create poll.

        If software finds out hld-file with expiration time in past,
        it must delete such hld-file.

        For information purpose second line of hld-file may contain one
        line PID information.

  4.3.  try control file

        This control file is created by mailer in time when try to
        connect is finished - successful or not. It has name same as
        flow file and extension ".try".

        Existing try-file is replaced by new one.

        try-file must contain one line string with diagnostic message.
        It serves for information purpose only.

        For information purpose second line of try-file may contain one
        line PID information.
