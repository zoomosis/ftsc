Status of this document
-----------------------

  This document is a Fidonet Standard (FTS).

  This document specifies a Fidonet standard for the Fidonet
  community.

  This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
  copied or modified for any purpose whatever.


Abstract
--------

  Current practice for Fidonet Technology Networks (FTN) is to
  maintain a nodelist used to store the details of the nodes in
  the network, and the network structure.


1. Supercessions
----------------

  FTS-0005 superceded and replaced the documents known under the names
  of FSC-0002, and FTS-0002.

  This document supercedes and replaces FTS-0005, FSC-0009, FSC-0040,
  FSC-0075, FSC-0091, and FSP-1012.

2. Purpose
----------
  
  Along with the companion technical standard (FTS-5001) this document
  defines the format and content of the nodelist for the FidoNet
  International Hobby Network. The FTS-5001 is seperated into two
  parts - the first part is a listing of authorized flags and the
  second part is a registry of userflags. The registry is used to
  prevent a userflag from being used for more than one meaning. The
  registry is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee
  Working Group D (the Nodelist).

3. Publication and Distribution
-------------------------------

  The nodelist is published as an ASCII text file named NODELIST.nnn,
  where nnn is the day-of-year of the publication date.
  For actual distribution,  NODELIST.nnn is packed into an archive
  file named NODELIST.Pnn,  where nn are the last two digits of day-of
  -year and P is the compression format used as listed below.
        A = .arc
        Z = .zip
        J = .arj
        R = .rar
  Since .zip is useable on most computer platforms, it is recommended
  that this format be used for distribution of the Distribution
  Nodelist.


4. Contents
-----------

  As stated above,  NODELIST.nnn is an ASCII text file.  It contains
  two kinds of lines,  comment lines and data lines.  Each line is
  terminated with an ASCII carriage return and line feed character
  sequence, and contains no trailing white-space (spaces, tabs, etc.).
  The file is terminated with an end-of-file character, ASCII <EOF>
  (1AH).

  Comments lines contain a semicolon (;) in the first character
  position followed by zero or more alphabetic characters called
  "interest flags". A program which processes the nodelist may use
  comment interest flags to determine the disposition of a comment
  line.  The remainder of a comment line (with one exception, treated
  below) is free-form ASCII text.

  There are five interest flags defined as follows:

     ;S This comment is of particular interest to Sysops.

     ;U This comment is of particular interest to BBS users.

     ;F This comment should appear in any formatted "Fido List".

     ;A This comment is of general interest (shorthand for ;SUF).

     ;E This comment is an error message inserted by a nodelist
        generating program.

     ;  This comment may be ignored by a nodelist processor.

  The first line of a nodelist is a special comment line containing
  identification data for the particular edition of the nodelist. The
  following is an example of the first line of a nodelist:

  ;A FidoNet Nodelist for Friday, July 3, 1987 --
       Day number 184 : 15943

  This line contains the general interest flag,  the day,  date,  and
  day-of-year number of publication,  and ends with a 5-digit decimal
  number with leading zeros, if necessary.  This number is the decimal
  representation of a check value derived as follows:

     Beginning with the first character of the second line,  a 16-bit
     cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is calculated for the entire file,
     including carriage return and line feed characters,  but not
     including the terminating EOF character.  The check polynomial
     used is the same one used for many file transfer protocols:

          2**16 + 2**12 + 2**5 + 2**0

  The CRC may be used to verify that the file has not been edited. The
  importance of this will become evident in the discussion of NODEDIFF
  below.  CRC calculation techniques are well documented in the
  literature,  and will not be treated further here.

  The content of the remaining comments in the nodelist are intended
  to be informative. Beyond the use of interest flags for distribution
  , a processing program need not have any interest in them.

  A nodelist data line contains eight variable length "fields"
  separated by commas (,).  No space characters are allowed in a data
  line, and  underscore characters are used in lieu of spaces.  The
  term "alphanumeric character" is defined as the portion of the ASCII
  character set from 20 hex through 7E hex, inclusive.  The following
  discussion defines the contents of each field in a data line.


  Field 1: Keyword

  The keyword field may be empty, or may contain exactly one keyword
  approved by the Zone Coordinator Council. Current approved keywords
  are:

     Zone  --
          Begins the definition of a geographic zone and define its
          coordinator.  All the data lines following a line with the
          "Zone" keyword down to, but not including, the next
          occurrence of a "Zone" keyword, are regions, nets, and
          nodes within the defined zone.

     Region --
          Begins the definition of a geographic region and defines its
          coordinator.  All the data lines following a line with the
          "Region" keyword down to, but not including, the next
          occurrence of a "Zone", "Region", or "Host" keyword, are
          independent nodes within the defined region.

     Host --
          Begins the definition of a local network and defines its
          host. All the data lines following a line with the Host
          keyword down to, but not including,  the next occurrence of
          a "Zone", "Region", or "Host" keyword, are local nodes,
          members of the defined local network.

     Hub --
          Begins the definition of a routing subunit within a
          multilevel local network.  The hub is the routing focal
          point for nodes listed below it until the next occurrence
          of a "Zone", "Region", "Host", or "Hub" keyword.  The hub
          entry MUST be a redundant entry,  with a unique number,
          for one of the nodes listed below it.  This is necessary
          because some nodelist processors eliminate these entries
          in all but the local network.

     Pvt --
          Defines a private node with unlisted number.  Private nodes
          are only allowed as members of local networks.

     Hold --
         Defines a node which is temporarily down,or  is a region/zone
         independent node which is reachable via IP only. Mail may be
         sent to it and is held by its host or coordinator.

     Down --
          Defines a node which is not operational.  Mail may NOT be
          sent to it.  This keyword may not be used for longer than
          two weeks on any single node,  at which point the "down"
          node is to be removed from the nodelist.


     <empty> --
          Defines a normal node entry.



  Field 2 - Zone/Region/Net/Node number

     This field contains only numeric digits and is a number in the
     range of 1 to 32767.  If the line had the "Zone",  "Region",  or
     "Host" keyword,  the number is the zone, net, or region number,
     and the node has an implied node number of 0, therfore the use of
     a 0 in this field is strictly forbidden.  Otherwise,  the
     number is the node number. The zone number, region or net number,
     and the node number, taken together, constitute a node's FidoNet
     address.

     Zone numbers must be unique.  Region or net numbers must be
     unique within their zone.  Hub numbers must be within their net.
     Node numbers must be unique within their region (for regional
     independents) or net (for members of a local network).  Duplicate
     node numbers under different hubs within the same net are not
     allowed.

  Field 3 - Node name

     This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
     commas and spaces.  Underscores are used to represent spaces.
     This is the name by which the node is known.
     For IP nodes this field may alternately contain an ip address or
     E-Mail address for email tunneling programs.

  Field 4 - Location

     This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
     commas and spaces.  Underscores are used to represent spaces.
     This field contains the location of the node.  It is usually
     expressed as the primary local location (town,  suburb,  city,
     etc.) plus the identifier of the regional geopolitical admin-
     istrative district (state,  province,  department,  county,
     etc.).  Wherever possible,  standard postal abbreviations for
     the major regional district should be used (IL, BC, NSW, etc.).

  Field 5 - Sysop name

     This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
     commas and spaces.  Underscores are used to represent spaces.
     This is the name of the system operator.

  Field 6 - Phone number

     This field contains at least three and usually four numeric
     subfields separated by dashes (-).  The fields are country code,
     city or area code, exchange code, and number.  The various parts
     of the phone number are frequently used to derive cost and
     routing information, as well as what number is to be dialed.
     A typical example of the data in a phone number field is 1-800-
     555-1212, corresponding to country 1 (USA),  area 800 (inbound
     WATS), exchange 555, and number 1212.

     Alternatively, this field may contain the notation -Unpublished-
     in the case of a private node.  In this case, the keyword "Pvt"
     must appear on the line.

    This field may also contain the IP address for an IP node
    utilizing the country code of 000.

  Field 7 - Baud rate

     This field contains the maximum baud rate supported by the node.
     (eg: 9600, 14400, 38400, etc)

  Field 8 - Flags

     This optional field contains data about the specific operation of
     the node, such as file requests, modem protocol supported, etc.
     Any text following the seventh comma on a data line is taken
     collectively to be the flags field.  The required format is zero
     or more subfields, separated by commas.  Each subfield consists
     of a flag, possibly followed by a value. The authorized flags
     for use in the distribution nodelist are distributed as in
     FTS-5001 to facilitate additions and deletions of the authorized
     flags without requiring an amendment to this FTS.

     FTSC recognizes that the FidoNet Zone Coordinator Council with
     the International Coordinator as the ZCC Chairman is the
     ultimate authority over what appears in the FidoNet nodelist.
     Also, FTSC is by definition a deliberative body,  and adding or
     changing a flag may take a considerable amount of time.
     Therefore, the  FidoNet International Coordinator or Zone
     Coordinators may temporarily  make changes or additions to the
     flags as defined in FTS-5001.  The FidoNet International
     Coordinator/Zone Coordinators will then consult with FTSC over
     the changes needed to FTS-5001 to reflect these temporary
     changes.

5. Nodediff
-----------

  With more than twenty thousand nodes as of this date,  the nodelist,
  even in archive form,  is a substantial document (or file).  Since
  distribution is via electronic file transfer,  this file is NOT
  routinely distributed.  Instead, when a new nodelist is prepared, it
  is compared with the previous week's nodelist, and a file containing
  only the differences is created and distributed.

  The distribution file,  called NODEDIFF.nnn,  where nnn is the
  day-of-year of publication, is actually an editing script which will
  transform the previous week's nodelist into the current nodelist.  A
  definition of its format follows:

  The first line of NODEDIFF.nnn is an exact copy of the first line of
  LAST WEEK'S nodelist. This is used as a first-level confidence check
  to insure that the right file is being edited.  The second and sub-
  sequent lines are editing commands and editing data.

  There are three editing commands and all have the same format:

          <command><number>

     <command> is a 1-letter command;  A,  C,  or D.  <number> is a
     decimal number greater than zero,  and defines the number of
     lines to be operated on by the command.  Each command appears on
     a line by itself.  The commands have the following meanings:

     Ann - Add the following nn lines to the output file.

     Cnn - Copy nn unchanged lines from the input to the output file.

     Dnn - Delete  nn lines from the input file.

  The following illustrate how the first few lines of NODEDIFF.213
  might look:

     ;A Friday, July 25, 1986 -- Day number 206 : 27712
     D2
     A2
     ;A Friday, August 1, 1986 -- Day number 213 : 05060
     ;A
     C5

  This fragment illustrates all three editing commands. The first line
  is the first line from NODELIST.206.  The next line says "delete the
  first two lines" from NODELIST.206.  These are the identification
  line and the line following it.  The next command says "add the next
  two lines" to NODELIST.213.  The two data lines are followed by a
  command which says "copy five unchanged lines" from NODELIST.206 to
  NODELIST .213.  Notice that the first line added will ALWAYS contain
  the new nodelist's CRC.

  Since only the differences will be distributed,  it is important to
  insure the accuracy of the newly created nodelist.  This is the
  function of the CRC mentioned above.  It is sufficient for a program
  designed to perform the above edits to pick the CRC value from the
  first line added to the output file, then compute the CRC of the
  rest of the output file.  If the two CRCs do not agree,  one of the
  input files has been corrupted.  If they do agree,  the probability
  is very high (but not 100%) that the output file is accurate.

  For actual distribution, NODEDIFF.nnn is packed into an archive file
  named NODEDIFF.Pnn,  where nn are the last two digits of day-of-year
  and P is the compression format used as listed below.
        A = .arc
        Z = .zip
        J = .arj
        R = .rar
  Since .zip is useable on most computer platforms, it is recommended
  that this format be used for distribution of the Distribution
  Nodediff.
