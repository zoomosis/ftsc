Translation of a Fidonet address into an internet domain name.
-+-----------------------------------------------------------

  Fidonet addressing uses the following format:

  ZZ:NN/FF.PP@DO

  where the fields refer to...

  ZZ - Zone Number:  The zone the node is part of.
                     Min: 1 Max: 32767
                     If 'ZZ:' is missing then assume 1 as the zone.

  NN - Net Number:   The network the node is a member of.
                     Min: 1 Max: 32767
                     Must be present.

  FF - Node Number:  The actual node number.
                     Min: -1 Max: 32767
                     Must be present.

  PP - Point Number: If the system is a point rather than a node then
                     this is their point number off the node.
                     Min: 0 Max: 32767
                     If '.PP' is missing then assume 0 (ie not a
                     point) as the point number.

  DO - Domain:       The name of the 'Fidonet Technology Network'.
                     Maximum length of 8 characters. The domain
                     should not include periods, thus 'fidonet.org'
                     is invalid (should be 'fidonet').
                     If '@DO' is missing then 'fidonet' can be 
                     assumed.

  The following are all valid examples:
      1:234/5.6@fidonet  (a '5D' address)   => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
      2:345/6.7          (a '4D' address)   => 2:345/6.7@fidonet


  Fidonet address should be translated into FQDN (Fully Qualified
  Domain Name) as:

  [pPP.]fFF.nNN.zZZ.DD.RD

  where the fields refer to...

  PP        - Point Number: As Fidonet address (FA)
                            If '.pPP' is missing 0 is assumed.

  FF        - Node Number:  As FA
                            Must be present.

  NN        - Net Number:   As FA
                            Must be present.

  ZZ        - Zone Number:  As FA
                            Must be present.

  DD        - Domain:       As FA
                            Must be present.

  RD        - Root Domain:  Root internet domain.
                            Must be present

  The following are all valid examples (assuming 'org' is a root
  internet domain):

  p6.f5.n234.z1.fidonet.org  => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
  p78.f6.n34.z2.fidonet.org  => 2:34/6.78@fidonet
  f3.n610.z4.fidonet.org     => 4:610/3.0@fidonet

  The following are all valid examples (assuming 'net' is a root
  internet domain):

  p6.f5.n234.z1.fidonet.net  => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
  p78.f6.n34.z2.fidonet.net  => 2:34/6.78@fidonet
  f3.n610.z4.fidonet.net     => 4:610/3.0@fidonet

  The following are all valid examples (assuming 'foo.bar' is a root
  internet domain):

  p6.f5.n234.z1.fidonet.foo.bar  => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
  p78.f6.n34.z2.fidonet.foo.bar  => 2:34/6.78@fidonet
  f3.n610.z4.fidonet.foo.bar     => 4:610/3.0@fidonet

  and if 'other.domain' is a root domain for 'othernet':

  f2.n95.z955.othernet.other.domain => 955:95/2.0@othernet


Flag indicating root internet domain for translation
of a Fidonet address into an internet domain name.
-+--------------------------------------------------

  To indicate which root internet domain should be used for
  translation of a Fidonet address into internet domain name
  there is a need to implement a set of the nodelist flags.
  The flags have a scope influence, which means that flag in
  a zone entry defines default root domain for a zone, flag
  in a region entry defines default root domain for a region,
  flag in a host entry defines default root domain for a network,
  flag in any other entry defines default root domain for an
  individual node.

  A format of the flags is:

  DOM:RD
  DO4:RD
  DO3:RD
  DO2:RD
  DO1:RD

  where the fields refer to...

  DOM,
  DO4,
  DO3,
  DO2,
  DO1 - flag names
  RD  - root internet domain

  DOM - assumes 5D addressing scheme ([pPP.]fFF.nNN.zZZ.fidonet.RD)
  DO4 - assumes 4D addressing scheme ([pPP.]fFF.nNN.zZZ.RD)
  DO3 - assumes 3D addressing scheme (fFF.nNN.zZZ.RD)
  DO2 - assumes 2D addressing scheme (fFF.nNN.RD)
  DO1 - assumes 1D addressing scheme (fFF.RD)

  The following are all valid examples:

  Zone,1,...,DOM:org,...

  which means 'org' domain is default for zone 1 and FQDNs
  of the nodes of Fidonet zone 1 are expected to have a look:

  [pPP.]fFF.nNN.z1.fidonet.org

  Zone,2,...,DO4:fidonet.org,...

  which means 'org' domain is default for zone 2 and FQDNs
  of the nodes of Fidonet zone 2 are expected to have a look:

  [pPP.]fFF.nNN.z2.fidonet.org

  Region,50,...,DOM:net,...

  which means 'net' domain is default for region 50 of
  zone 2 and FQDNs of nodes in Fidonet region 50 of zone 2
  are expected to have a look:

  [pPP.]fFF.n50NN.z2.fidonet.net

  Host,5020,...,DO4:moscow.ru,...

  which means 'moscow.ru' is a root domain for the
  network 5020 of zone 2 and FQDNs of the nodes of the
  Fidonet network 5020 of zone 2 are expected to have
  a look:

  [pPP.]fFF.n5020.z2.moscow.ru

  ,1234,...,DO2:let.me.alone,...

  which means 'let.me.alone' is a root domain for a node
  1234 of network 5020 of zone 2 and FQDN of a node 1234
  of network 5020 of zone 2 of Fidonet is expected to have
  a look:

  f1234.nNN.let.me.alone

  ,1234,...,DO1:let.me.alone

  which means 'let.me.alone' is a root domain for a node
  1234 of network 5020 of zone 2 and FQDN of a node 1234
  of network 5020 of zone 2 of Fidonet is expected to have
  a look:

  f1234.let.me.alone
