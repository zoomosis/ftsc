Implementors have had problems interpreting message text, both in netmail and
echomail.  While the clues are usually to be found in some doucment or another,
there seems to be a need to collect hints for some confusing aspects.  This
informal document attempts to address that need.


Filter out all <lf>s and 'soft' <cr>s and <lf>s.  They are surplus and will
only confuse the rest of your code.

All control lines have their sentinels at the beginning of a line.  [ Note
that an * Origin: line has a leading significant blank. ]

Do not process quoted control lines or control sentinels preceeded by blanks,
tabs, ...

If you become confused, then bounce or sidetrack the message to a hold area
for human intervention.  Don't try to rescue the situation.  None will notice
when you succeed, and many will flame whan you fail.

A message is either netmail or echomail.  I.e. no ^aINTL, ^aFMPT, or ^aTOPT
controls should be found or generated when there is an AREA: line or when in an
echo area. Thus, echomail can not be routed across zones, but this is not a big
loss.

Private netmail replies to echomail are netmail, i.e. may have ^aINTL etc.,
and may not have AREA: line, SEEN-BY:, or ^aPATH: lines.  They may have a tear
line and an origin line.

^aEID lines are as in Opus 1.03.  Other forms are not to be generated, and,
if found, may be safely disgarded.

An AREA: line must be the first non ^a line in the text.

The echomail control info is a four-part package at the end of the text.  It
should not be, but occasionally is, followed by one or more ^a control lines.
The four parts of an echomail trailer are:

  o a tear line, "---" and some very short text identifying the original echo
    processor.  Eg.
        --- Brag 3.14

  * note that some internetworking gateware may place a # Origin: line between
    the tear line and the * Origin: line to indicate the true other network
    address, whatver that may be.  The content of a # Origin: line is free to
    be specified by the other network(s).  An example might be as follows:
         # Origin: Political Statement (FishNet:914@201)

  o one * Origin: line, being " * Origin: " ends in "(" [Z:] N "/" N [.P] ")"
    of FidoNet node of origin or the gate from FidoNet to another network
         * Origin: <signature> (1:105/301)

  o as many SEEN-BY: lines as necessary, each being "SEEN-BY:" followed by one
    or more
        " " <net> "/" <node>
    sequences.  Note that SEEN-BY: lines do not end in <space>.

    The net/node numbers in SEEN-BY: lines are sorted net major.  Within a
    single SEEN-BY: line, net numbers are sticky, so the N/N is usually
    abbreviated to N, Eg. 
        SEEN-BY: 105/6 10 15 16 27 41 42 300 301 141/42 491

  o as many ^aPATH: lines as necessary, each being <ctrl-A> "PATH:" followed
    by one or more
        " " <net> "/" <node>
    sequences.  The N/N in ^aPATH: lines are specifically not sorted.  Net
    numbers are also sticky in ^aPATH: lines, eg.
        PATH: 105/301 6 42

Remember that traffic costs much money, and do not create text unnecessary to
FidoNet as a whole.

I did not invent this, so don't blame me.  I'm just trying to write it down.

And, lastly, try not to be inventive.  While the free-form syntax of this
embedded stuff does provide fleibility and power, it also leaves a lot of room
to make disgusting messes.  Compromise, cooperation, and a minimizalist touch
are essential.
