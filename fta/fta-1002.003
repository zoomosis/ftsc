2. FSP Content Guidelines
-------------------------

  Standards Proposals should be written with the following guidelines
  in mind:

   1. Descriptions of implementations should be concise.
   2. Plain language should be used in preference to technical jargon.
   3. History and operational advice should be avoided.
   4. Data on technical structure and usage statistics is encouraged.
   5. Explanations should be clear to less-experienced programmers.


3. FTS Format
-------------

  For ease of reading and consistency, all Technical Standards
  documents, and Standards Proposal documents, after an FTSC number
  has been assigned, shall use the following format:

  3.1 A standard FTSC banner at the top of the document
  -----------------------------------------------------

  1. FTSC publication number.
  2. Revision number.
  3. Short title of document
  4. Author of document.
  5. Date.         (In ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  6. Summary of contents of document


  3.2 Document Formatting
  -----------------------

  Major Header titles and Introductory text alignment are to be left
  flush (i.e. starting at the leftmost column) with a maximum line
  length of 70 columns (excluding the line terminator), to permit easy
  conversion to a Fidonews posting.
  The line terminator shall be a CR,LF combination.

  The major paragraph title is left flushed and underlined with dashes
  ('-').

  Text is indented two spaces from the major paragraph title. In
  sub-paragraphs, text is indented to below the title.

  Generally, decimal numbering is used.


  3.3 A brief history of revisions
  --------------------------------

  The format of the revision history is:

    Rev.x, yyyy-mm-dd: <short comments>

  See this document and recent FTS's for examples of the document
  formatting in action.


4. Reformatting
---------------

  The FTSC reserves the right to reformat submitted documents at any
  time in any way to make them conform to this document, or convert
  them to any other format necessary for publication.

  Rev.2, 1997-12-29: Author changed to Administrator. Reformatted and
                     updated the format specification. Revision number
                     added.
  Rev.2, 2014-04-27: Replaced "Revision Date" by "Date" and
                     removed "Expiry Date" in header.
